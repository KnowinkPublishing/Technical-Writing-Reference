## Why is this needed?

As a programmer making the transition to a full fledge tech writer, the internet is my main resource of knowledge for my career change. I have found there is an abundance of information out there, blogs, web sites, pdf files, user guides, book references, all dedicated to technical writing. But I have not found an all inclusive reference. A place where everything is categorized. Seeing a need I thought I would fill in the knowledge gap.

## How Is It Organized?

The list is organized alphabetically by topic and then alphabetically within the topic. The main topics I have selected are:

1. Blogs and Websites
2. Books and Professional Study Guides
3. Coding
4. Education
5. Organizations
6. User Guides

Entries may be duplicated if they satisfy two criteria. For example, The DITA Style Guide is a book but also provides coding information. Therefore it is placed under both the Books and Professional Study Guides and Coding sections.
