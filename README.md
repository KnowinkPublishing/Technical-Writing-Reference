# Technical-Writing-Reference

A collection of links about technical writing.

## Why is this needed?

As a programmer making the transition to a full fledge tech writer, the internet is my main resource of knowledge for my career change. I have found there is an abundance of information out there, blogs, web sites, pdf files, user guides, book references, all dedicated to technical writing. But I have not found an all inclusive reference. A place where everything is categorized. Seeing a need I thought I would fill in the knowledge gap.

## How Is It Organized?

The list is organized alphabetically by topic and then alphabetically within the topic. The main topics I have selected are:

1. Blogs and Websites
2. Books and Professional Study Guides
3. Coding
4. Education & Training
5. Organizations
6. User Guides

Entries may be duplicated if they satisfy two criteria. For example, The DITA Style Guide is a book but also provides coding information. Therefore it is placed under both the Books and Professional Study Guides and Coding sections. 

Education and Training is divided into education companies, such as Udemy and post secondary education organizations such as tech school, colleges and universities, When there is overlap, such as University of Georgia's Fundamental's of Technical Writing CE course, which is actually run by Ed2Go, it is noted.

## What Do The Symbols Represent?

[$] There is some sort of payment associated with it, such as a book that needs to be purchased or an organization that requires a membership fee.\
[âˆ†] The link leads to some sort of sponsored content. Bear that in mind when visiting.\
[>] The education content (CEU's for example) is presented under this organization's branding but managed by another organization. 

## Can I Contribute?

By all means. Find some relevant content and add it to the site. 

Coding format: For the most part this is created in Markdown. I did cheat a little to get the indentations by prefixing &nbsp; to some lines. In Markdown an entry would look like:

~~~
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_A free and open-source reference guide that explains how to use Markdown._
~~~

and should appear like this in the browser:
